## Neon EVM core

Neon EVM program is a smart contract on the Solana blockchain. This allows Neon EVM to receive Ethereum-like transactions and process them on Solana according to Ethereum rules. Ethereum transactions going through Neon EVM, called Neon Transactions, are used as inputs for the targeted Neon Clients.

Neon Proxy is an essential tool for packaging a Neon transaction into a Solana transaction. It improves the user experience for Operators in the Neon ecosystem, and it allows Ethereum dApps to be ported to Neon with virtually no code or configuration changes as all the “translating” is handled by the proxy.

Neon Operator run Neon Proxy servers, which helps facilitate seamless execution of Ethereum-like transactions on Solana. This allows Ethereum dApps to be ported to Neon with no code change.

Tokens - on Neon EVM you can use
* NEON token as a gas
* ERC-20 with SPL under the hood
* Gas fees link to Learn in dev section

## Integrations

Tracing API + How to use The Graph

Tracer API is an extension for Neon Proxy: for historical requests Neon Labs implemented a Tracing API to help developers better test, debug, and understand their smart contracts on the Neon EVM. The API will give developers a full externality trace on any transaction executed on the chain. They’ll be able to rerun historic transactions, run new transactions on historic states, and analyze the state of the blockchain after the execution of each instruction.
