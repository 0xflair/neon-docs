# Getting started

*The purpose of this guide is to familiarize you with the structure of the Neon EVM, provide step-by-step instructions to set up your local Neon EVM development environment, and use the environment to install, configure, and test your local Solana cluster. You can also find a summary of our documenting methodology here.*

## Fundamental topics
If you are new to the Neon EVM development, we recommend starting from the very beginning and moving forward to each of the topics.  

[ðŸ”˜ Web2 vs Web3](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/software_manuals/foundational_topics/web3) â€” Describes the fundamental differences between Web2 and Web3.  
[ðŸ”˜ An Ethereum account](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/software_manuals/foundational_topics/account) â€” An entity with an ETH balance that can send transactions on Ethereum.  
[ðŸ”˜ An Ethereum transaction](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/software_manuals/foundational_topics/transaction) â€” A cryptographically signed instruction from an account.  
[ðŸ”˜ Block](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/software_manuals/foundational_topics/block) â€” A special structure for recording a group of transactions in blockchain systems.  
[ðŸ”˜ Gas](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/software_manuals/foundational_topics/gas) â€” Computational power represented in tokens that is required to process transactions

## Setting up the local development environment
As a developer, begin with exploring the Neon EVM framework, setting up your local development environment, which includes installing, configuring, and testing your local Solana cluster. After setting up the local development environment, you can progress to run your applications on the Solana cluster.  

[ðŸ”˜ Ethereum and Solana capabilities in a single solution](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/devportal/eth_sol_solution) â€” Describes a unique solution that allows Ethereum users to use the key features of Solana and vice versa.  
[ðŸ”˜ Neon EVM Architecture](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/devportal/neon_evm_arch) â€” Describes the architectural solutions built into the Neon EVM that enable fast transaction processing for Ethereum users.  
[ðŸ”˜ Installation and setup](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/solana_cluster/cluster_installation) â€” Describes how to install, configure and test the local Solana cluster.  
[ðŸ”˜ Connecting to the Solana cluster via proxy server](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/devportal/testnet/connect_to_solana_via_proxy) â€” Describes how to interact with the Solana cluster.

## Summary of the Neon EVM documentation
The documentation is an open-source community effort, so feel free to suggest new topics or add new content wherever you think it might be helpful. All documentation is available for editing via GitHub.  

[ðŸ”˜ How to maintain docs](https://docs.neonlabs.org/docs/software_manuals/how_to_guides/support_docs) â€” Describes the methodology for making changes to the Neon EVM documentation.
