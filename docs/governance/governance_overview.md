# Governance Overview

## Objectives of Governance
Neon governance is the process by which community stakeholders must ensure:
  * Reach consensus on solving issues that cannot be fully covered by software algorithms.
  * Implementation of the decisions they make.
  * Change the governance rules themselves through contractual amendments.

Since the results depend on Neon stability, a high level of coordination must be ensured when making changes to the management and technical processes to ensure that any changes to Neon are secure and approved by the community. It is also necessary to make the process of resolving issues related to Neon management transparent.

## Submitting and evaluating proposals
Any one of the community can submit an idea called a Neon improvement proposal. Each proposal is included in the list of promising solutions (use cases) and discussed on a forum. After a proposal is submitted it goes through a formal life cycle of technical reviews, research, and discussions. The need for discussion allows management to exclude the implementation of inefficient or risky solutions in Neon.

Proposals can affect both the management and technical processes of Neon. If this is a proposal to change the logic of system contracts or to improve the technical capabilities of Neon, then this proposal must be previously tested on either devnet or testnet. Proposals for the implementation of new features associated with risk or high labor costs go through the following formal process:
  * Substantiation of the need to implement this proposal, taking into account its labor intensity and relevance.
  * Development of technical specifications for the implementation of this proposal.
  * Conducting a contest to select a contractor for the implementation of the proposal. The contractor may be an individual, a group of individuals, or a third-party company.
  * Verification and decision on acceptance of the work done.

Stakeholders make the final decision to change the logic of system contracts, to implement new functionality associated with risks or high costs, and can also take action against community members whose actions may harm the development of Neon.

Stakeholders make all decisions through voting using the Neon Governance application. You can see the status of current proposals and decisions of stakeholders on the [Neon governance](https://governance.neon-labs.org/governances/5AiHoX6Ji48mdE2ipsjociycyXbhmVQPawhJXeZ5Lf1e?programId=5ZYgDTqLbYJ2UAtF7rbUboSt9Q6bunCQgGEwxDFrQrXb) application page.

## General statements for stakeholders

  * Members must not initiate a threat against another member.
  * No any member should improperly influence the vote of another.
  * Members agree to hold software developers harmless for unintentional mistakes made by them in the expression of contractual intent, whether or not said mistakes were due to actual or perceived negligence.
