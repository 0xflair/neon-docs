## Introduction

The goal of Neon's decentralized governance system is to allow the community of token holders to have a say in how the protocol is advanced. The governance process includes core developers, application developers, operators, users, and other contributors in order to come to a consensus on solving issues and developing rules for the functioning of governance. The rules can be changed by contractual amendments as decided by the stakeholders.

Neon governance is the process by which community stakeholders:
  * Reach consensus on solving issues that cannot be fully covered by software algorithms.
  * Develop rules for the functioning of governance in accordance with the decisions stakeholders make, and record and store rules within the blockchain.
  * Change the governance rules themselves through contractual amendments.

Since the results depend on Neon stability, a high level of coordination must be ensured when making changes to the management and technical processes to ensure that any changes to Neon are secure and approved by the community. It is also necessary to make the process of resolving issues related to Neon management transparent.

Guiding principles for engagement with Neon's governance process include:

- Respecting the rights of all Neon community members

- Acting in good faith

- Seeking to resolve disputes in a constructive and collaborative manner

- Encouraging a diversity of perspectives

- Promoting openness and transparency

### Principles and Objectives

Principles

* Members must not threaten other members.
* No member should improperly influence the vote of another.
* Members agree to hold software developers harmless for unintentional mistakes made by them in the expression of contractual intent, whether or not said mistakes were due to actual or perceived negligence.

## Governance on Neon: Organization

The Neon network is decentralized and its economy fee-based, with NEON tokens being used for its governance. 

Neon's governance framework is handled by a decentralized protocol with a clear and user-friendly process for proposing and voting for protocol improvements.

## Submitting and Evaluating Proposals

Any Neon user can submit an idea, which is called a Neon improvement proposal. Each proposal is included in the list of promising solutions (use cases) and discussed on a forum. After a proposal is submitted, it goes through a formal life cycle of technical reviews, research, and discussions. The need for discussion allows management to exclude the implementation of inefficient or risky solutions in Neon.

Proposals can affect both the management and technical processes of Neon. If this is a proposal to change the logic of system contracts or to improve the technical capabilities of Neon, then this proposal must be tested on either Devnet or Testnet. Proposals for the implementation of new features associated with risk or high labor costs go through the following formal process:
  * Substantiation of the need to implement this proposal, taking into account its labor intensity and relevance.
  * Development of technical specifications for the implementation of this proposal.
  * Appointment of a worker for the implementation of the proposal. The worker may be an individual, a group of individuals, or a third-party company.
  * Verification and decision on acceptance of the work done.

Stakeholders make the final decision to change the logic of system contracts, to implement new functionality associated with risks or high costs, and can also take action against community members whose actions may harm the development of Neon.

Stakeholders make all decisions through voting using the Neon Governance application. The status of current proposals and decisions on them are displayed on the main page of the *Neon Governance* application.
