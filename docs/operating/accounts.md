## TL;DR

- Operator keys are whitelisted for Proxy access
- Key accounts provide SOL to support Neon EVM transactions
- Account balances may be queried and topped up
- Security of accounts is a consideration

## The Operator key

The Operator key is an account that is whitelisted by the Neon EVM. Neon Proxy creates several holder accounts linked to each Neon Operator key (if the Neon Operator key has enough SOLs).

> Neon DAO provides the governance to determine the whitelist.

## Holder accounts

Holder accounts are a crucial element of Neon EVM. Neon Proxy creates holder accounts with [rent-exempt balances](https://docs.solana.com/ru/developing/programming-model/accounts#rent) on start. The number of holder accounts created determines the TPS provided to users and can be configured with `PRX_PERM_ACCOUNT_LIMIT`. 

You may retrieve a list of Neon Operator key accounts and attached holder accounts (see [**Retrieve your balance**](#query-balance), below).

## Account balance

The Neon Operator maintains a balance of SOLs in the account associated with each Operator key to pay gas on Solana in SOLs to process Neon transactions.

### Required balance

We recommend maintaining a balance of 100â€”200 SOLs in Neon Operator key accounts.

:::caution

Best practice is to use the dedicated script (wip: coming soon!) to automatically transfer SOLs to your Neon Operator key accounts when the balance becomes too low. This security measure avoids storing excessive SOLs in Neon Operator key accounts, to protect them from a malicious user. The potential vulnerability arises because the Neon Proxy has access to Neon Operator keys. Therefore, should a hacker gain access to the Neon Operator server they may get access to the Neon Proxy configuration with the Neon Operator keys.

### Query balance

You may query your balance visually or programmatically.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="View" label="View your balance" default>

Neon Proxy provides a local Grafana dashboad which monitors statistics in the Prometheus/Grafana. They display metrics from operator_neon_balance and operator_sol_balance.

<TabItem value="Retrieve" label="Retrieve your balance" default>

The command that retrieves the list of Neon Operator key accounts and attached holder accounts provided by your Proxy instance:

- Docker
```bash
docker exec -ti proxy ./proxy-cli.sh info solana-accounts
```

- Kubernetes
```bash
kubectl -nneon-proxy exec -it neon-proxy-0 -- ./proxy-cli.sh info solana-accounts
```
Returns both the account address and the account balances.

```

Alternatively, you may retrieve a structured JSON output with more detailed account information by using:

- Docker
```bash
docker exec -ti proxy ./proxy-cli.sh info | python3 -mjson.tool
```

- Kubernetes
```bash
kubectl -nneon-proxy exec -it neon-proxy-0 -- ./proxy-cli.sh info | python3 -mjson.tool
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Topup balance

Neon provides a docker compose file to add SOLs to your accounts. This is not released in the same cluster as the Proxy service, because it must access your SOL wallet. If you wish to use this tool,  choose a safe environment to run this.
