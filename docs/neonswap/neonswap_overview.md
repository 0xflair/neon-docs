# Neonswap overview

*The Neonswap is open source service being fork of [Uniswap V2](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2) and modified to work with Neon EVM.*  

Uniswap is an open-source [dapp](https://doc.neonlabs.org/docs/glossary#dapp) used on Ethereum. In Ethereum, exchanging some tokens for others requires deploying contracts. We want to demonstrate that our Neon EVM product allows you to port your applications that using the uniswap service, from Ethereum to Solana.The neonswap infrastructure provides full support for your applications on Neon EVM, as well as the uniswap-interface on a separate server. Using the neonswap service deployed on Neon EVM, users can make transactions in their usual form and make sure that Neon EVM is functioning successfully. No changes are required to port applications using the neonswap service.
