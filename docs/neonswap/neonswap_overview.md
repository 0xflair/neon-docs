# Neon Swap overview

*Neon Swap is open source service being fork of [Uniswap V2](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2) and modified to work with Neon EVM.*  

Uniswap is an open-source [dapp](https://doc.neonlabs.org/docs/glossary#dapp) used on Ethereum. In Ethereum, exchanging some tokens for others requires deploying contracts. We want to demonstrate that our Neon EVM product allows you to port your applications that using the uniswap service, from Ethereum to Solana. The Neon Swap infrastructure provides full support for your applications on Neon EVM, as well as the Neon Swap interface on a separate server. Using the Neon Swap service deployed on Neon EVM, users can make transactions in their usual form and make sure that Neon EVM is functioning successfully. No changes are required to port applications using the Neon Swap service.  

> **Neon Swap** service provides an opportunity for Ethereum users to migrate their applications to Neon EVM without any difficulties.
