# Neon Swap overview

*Neon Swap is open source service being fork of [Uniswap V2](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2) and modified to work with Neon EVM.*  

Neon Swap is an open-source [dApp](https://doc.neonlabs.org/docs/glossary#decentralized-application-dapp) whose main function is to provide the services required to deploy user Ethereum contracts on Neon EVM. In Ethereum, transactions, such as exchanging one token for another, require the deployment of contracts. These contracts operate using their specific services and cannot be deployed outside of this environment.

We want to demonstrate that our Neon EVM product allows you to transfer your applications from Ethereum to Solana and ensures their reliable functioning. The Neon Swap infrastructure provides full support for your applications on Neon EVM, as well as the swap interface on a separate server. Using the Neon Swap service deployed on Neon EVM, users can make transactions in their usual form and make sure that Neon EVM is functioning successfully. No changes are required to port applications using the Neon Swap service.  

> **[Neon Swap](https://doc.neonlabs.org/docs/glossary#neonswap)** service provides an opportunity for Ethereum users to migrate their applications to Neon EVM without any difficulties.
