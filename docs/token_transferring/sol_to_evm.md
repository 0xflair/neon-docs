[NeonPass](https://neonpass.live/) is an open-source service designed to transfer tokens between Solana and the Neon EVM, and provides users with the following features:
  * Transfer of SPL tokens from Solana to the Neon EVM to a non-existent account. The account with an ERC-20 balance is automatically created when transferring tokens.
  * Transfer of SPL tokens from Solana to the Neon EVM to an existing account with no ERC-20 balance. The balance is automatically created when transferring tokens.
  * Transfer of SPL tokens from Solana to the Neon EVM to an existing account with an ERC-20 balance.
  * Withdrawal of ERC-20 tokens from the Neon EVM to an existing account with an SPL balance in Solana.
  * Withdrawal of ERC-20 tokens from the Neon EVM to an existing account with no SPL balance in Solana. The balance is automatically created when transferring tokens.

Solana has its own ERC-20 tokens generated by the special application. These tokens are on the balances of SPL accounts inside Solana. Transactions with balances are possible only through a Solana wallet (for example, through [Phantom](about/terminology.md#phantom)). There is no way to directly manage these balances from the Neon EVM.

We provide you with NeonPass in order for you to make transactions with SPL tokens quickly and conveniently. To transfer tokens from Solana to the Neon EVM, as well as from the Neon EVM to Solana, two wallets are required: [Phantom](about/terminology.md#phantom) and [MetaMask](about/terminology.md#metamask), which provide the addresses of a recipient and a sender. Transactions are signed with keys obtained from these addresses.

> The NeonPass service provides Ethereum users with the ability to transfer SPL tokens to the Neon EVM and withdraw them back.

The ERC-20 wrapper allows users to manipulate balances inside SPL tokens. The user runs an application inside the Neon EVM with logic that releases new coins. To transfer these coins to the outside world, they need to use the ERC-20 bridge implementation. Inside the Neon EVM, these coins will be blocked and transferred inside the SPL token to different addresses. They will become liquid inside Solana, but under a different token name, which is registered inside Solana.

A user can also transfer part of the funds to their balance inside Neon EVM and convert it into a new token using a token exchange algorithm of their choice.

Ethereum tokens are generated in accordance with the ERC-20 standard. Therefore, to transfer tokens between the Solana and Ethereum blockchains, a separate ERC-20 wrapper must be deployed for each Solana token. The ERC-20 wrapper’s job is to ensure that the Solana applications interact with EVM (Solidity, Vyper, etc.) bytecode contracts, as well as to transfer funds in Solana tokens using Ethereum wallets such as MetaMask.

The main interacting component in the token transfer is the ERC-20 bridge, which is a separate contract. When it’s called, it generates a Solana token, which represents the corresponding ERC-20 token in the SPL token contract. The Solana tokens registered in the SPL token contract can be transferred to Solana contracts.
Bridge operators are responsible for the ERC-20 bridge operation. They get fees from the conversion of tokens.
