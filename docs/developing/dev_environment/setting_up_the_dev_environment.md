title: Setting up the Development Environment
---

As an aspiring Neon developer, you should begin by exploring the Neon EVM framework and setting up your local development environment.
Depending on your purposes, there are several ways to do it:

1. Local proxy with a local Solana cluster
2. Local proxy with a remote Solana cluster (Solana Devnet/Testnet)
3. Remote proxy with a remote Solana cluster (Solana Devnet/Testnet)

Some considerations that should go into setting up the most appropriate development environment are:

[ðŸ”˜ Choosing a Neon Proxy](developing/dev_environment/choosing_proxy.md) â€” Describes how to connect to an existing Neon Proxy  
[ðŸ”˜ Connecting to the Neon Proxy](developing/dev_environment/connect_to_solana_via_proxy.md) â€” If you know which Neon Proxy suits your needs the best, the next step is to connect to the Solana cluster via a local or remote proxy server  
[ðŸ”˜ Setting up a local Solana cluster](developing/dev_environment/solana_cluster/cluster_installation.md) â€” Describes how to install, configure, and test the local Solana cluster with Neon EVM onboard
