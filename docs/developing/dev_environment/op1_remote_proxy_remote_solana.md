title: "Option 1: Remote Proxy to Remote Solana"
---

## Prerequisites

[MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io/) must be already installed on your device.  

> Although this tutorial uses the *Ubuntu* operating system, these instructions can be applied to other Linux distros as well.

### Network Configuration
  * The [Solana cluster](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/overview) is accessed via a proxy hosted on a remote virtual server.
  * Solana works in test mode (recommended) and the proxy interacts with it through the Neon EVM.

### Connecting MetaMask to the Neon EVM Devnet
To connect MetaMask to the Neon EVM Devnet, follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](developing/getting_started.md#step-2-connect-metamask-to-the-neon-evm-devnet) page.
