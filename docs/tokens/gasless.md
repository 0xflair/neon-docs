## TL;DR

- Neon EVM provides a starter pack of gasless transactions

## Introduction

What happens if you do not yet own enough (or any) NEON to pay for your first transaction? Don't worry, we have you covered with a starter pack of gasless transactions.

These transactions are still handled by the Proxy Operator, however, the transaction cost is covered by us. This means if you bring assets into the Neon network, then the first transactions are free.

> This allows you to buy NEON tokens from you chosen DEX if you wish to continue using the service.

<!-- is this aimed at dApps, and so this is "if your user brings assets into Neon ?" -->
